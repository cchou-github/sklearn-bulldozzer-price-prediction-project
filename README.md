# sklearn-heart-disease-project

This project aims to practice building a model that predicts the future sale price of a bulldozer using machine learning and scikit-learn. The Jupyter notebook file provided below contains the trained and tuned model, the model evaluation, and a comparison of feature importance. You can access the file at: https://github.com/cchou-github/sklearn-bulldozzer-price-prediction-project/blob/main/end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb
